//use case: customer wants to know how many times an issue has been in X status.
//reason: it's another metric for them to report on.
//example: workflow has a "Rejection" status. If the issue is rejected 6 times throughout it's lifespan - a custom field should update to 6 (each time incrementally).

Automation rule

When: Issue transitioned to REJECTED
Then: Edit issue fields "Rejection_Counter"
--> {{#increment}}{{issue.Rejection_Counter}}{{/}}
